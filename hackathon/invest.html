          <b>WHAT IS AN INVESTMENT?</b>
          <p>
            An investment is way of putting your money into a savings bank account and gaining 
            interest on it so your money grows on its own. You can also buy something that you know will get more 
            expensive (like stocks) and then sell it for more money than you bought it for, so you can make a 
            profit (get more money than you spent)!
          </p>
          <p>
            Why should you make investments? Investments help you make your money grow instead of having it sit. 
            Investing allows you to expand your sources of money without really working a job. It can be used as a side income.
