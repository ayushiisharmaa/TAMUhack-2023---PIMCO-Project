          <b>CREDIT VS. DEBIT CARDS</b>
          <p>
            What is a credit card? A credit card is a card that does not take out the money from your account immediately. 
            The credit card company will pay for your transaction in the moment, but later you will have to pay the credit card 
            company back for all the money you spent in that month. If you donâ€™t pay the company back, then the company will charge 
            you interest on your bill which means that you will have to pay more and more money the longer you wait to pay them back. 
            A credit card can also help you get a credit score. If you pay your credit card bills on time, then you will have a good credit 
            score which can help you when you get older and need to take out loans for college or a car.

            What is a debit card? A debit card is a card that when you swipe it at some store to buy something, the money will be directly taken 
            out of your account and will pay that person.
