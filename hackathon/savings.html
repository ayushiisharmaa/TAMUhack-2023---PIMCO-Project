          <b>HOW TO SAVE</b>
          <p>
            What is savings? Savings include some money you set aside for emergencies like when you get sick and have to go 
            to the doctor or the hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            How do you save? Every time you get money, you set a percent of money aside in your savings envelope! You never 
            touch this envelope unless its 
            an emergency.
          </p>
            Why is it good to save? Savings help you have some extra money for things you do not plan for, like emergencies!
          <p>
            Saving is a really good habit because it enables us to understand how much money we need to spend and it prevents
            excessive spending on things that we don't really need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saving can be done in many ways: you can save at home in a piggy bank, or in a real bank where your money grows 
            due to interest.
          </p>
